Squeedo: The sexiest message consumer ever (â„¢)

This library allows you to quickly spin up a message consumer and worker
pool using core.async. The message is returned in its raw format,
so it's up to the caller to determine the proper reader for their purposes.

## Usage

    (require '[com.climate.squeedo.sqs-consumer :refer [start-consumer stop-consumer]])

    (def consumer (start-consumer "mosaic-layer-generation-request"
                                  (fn [message done-channel] 
                                    (println message)
                                    (put! done-channel message))))
    ;when done listening
    (stop-consumer consumer)
